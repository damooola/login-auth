   - Create a Firebase project through the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Firebase Authentication in your project.
   - Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app` directory.
   - Add your iOS app to the Firebase project and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file. Place it in the `ios/Runner` directory.

2. **Project Setup**:
   - Clone this repository or create a new Flutter project.
   - Add the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:

     ```yaml
